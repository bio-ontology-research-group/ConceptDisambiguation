# First approach

In the first approach we analyse each topic (diseases, genes and chemicals) in isolation, then
we build a feature vector for each topic. Finally we concatenate this three parts in a unique
feature vector, which is used to build the BOW representation.

The length of these vectors is about 1000 words and the
size of the corpus is 13.000 documents.
